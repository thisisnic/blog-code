Hi, I'm Nic.  I'm an R developer, currently working at Ursa Computing on Apache Arrow.  After completing a PhD in Psychology and Statistics, started off my career as an R consultant and educator, and developed a passion for breaking down complex topics and helping people level up their coding skills, co-authoring [a course on building R packages](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/developing-r-packages).

I then spent a few years expanding my skillset, working as a data scientist, developing end-to-end machine learning pipelines in R and Python.  I also worked on a large scale Shiny app, which I gave a talk about at RStudio Conference in 2019.

I'm now working at [Ursa Computing](https://ursacomputing.com/) on [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/), and absolutely loving being able to work full time on open source.

You can find me on Twitter: [@nic_crane](https://twitter.com/nic_crane), my CV is  [here](https://thisisnic.github.io/NCrane_CV_March_2021.pdf), or take a look at what I've been up to on [Github](https://github.com/thisisnic).

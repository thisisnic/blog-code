Hi, I'm Nic.  I'm currently working at Ursa Computing on Apache Arrow.  I'm co-author of the ["Developing R Packages" course on Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/developing-r-packages) and have made a couple of small contributions to the tidyverse. In my spare time, I love travel, comedy, and food - both the cooking and eating of!  Find me on Twitter: [@nic_crane](https://twitter.com/nic_crane).

When people use the phrase "modern C++", they're usually referring to C++ 11 onwards.  

# Libraries

The main libraries in C++ are:

1. The C++ standard library
2. Standard Template Library (contains things like algorithms, iterators, etc)
3. Boost (some really great stuff in here; some of it is moving into the standard library)
4. QT framework (for cross-platform UI)
5. Intel libraries
6. (lots of others!)

<h2>What is a pointer?</h2>
<p>A pointer is a variable that contains a memory address for a value.</p>
<p>If you pass a pointer into a function, you get a copy of that pointer (so it points to the same address).</p>
<p>If you then change the value of the copy inside of the function, it affects whatever is at the address that the pointer is pointing at.</p>
<p>You could point the pointer to different things, and when you dereference it, it will return the value of whatever is at the address is is pointed at.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-do-i-declare-a-pointer" class="section level2">
<h2>How do I declare a pointer?</h2>
<p>You can declare a pointer by putting an asterisk between the type declaration and the variable name.</p>
<pre class="cpp"><code>int *myPointer;</code></pre>

<h1>References</h1>
<div id="what-is-a-reference" class="section level2">
<h2>What is a reference?</h2>
<p>A reference points to a variable, it’s like a label. You can’t move references, they stay referring to the same variable/location in memory.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-do-i-declare-a-reference" class="section level2">
<h2>How do I declare a reference?</h2>
<p>You can declare a reference by putting an ampersand between the type declaration and the variable name.</p>
<pre class="cpp"><code>int &amp;myRef = someVar;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="pointer-references" class="section level1">
<h1>Pointer references</h1>
<p>If you pass by pointer reference (e.g. <code>void my_func(int * &amp; pRef)) pRef = 10</code>, then you pass in a reference to the pointer. You don’t make a copy; you’re adding an alternative name to the original pointer.</p>
<p>Therefore if you change the value of <code>pRef</code>, you change the value of anything else that is pointing at that address.</p>
</div>

<h1>Examples</h1>
<p>This example is from the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWYnUGnChhA">here</a>.</p>
<pre class="cpp"><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

// we pass in a copy of the integer into the function
void passByVal(int val);

// pass by reference
// doesn&#39;t matter if the ampersand is touching in or val
// passes in the actual variable
void passByRef(int &amp; ref);

// pass in the pointer
// same as above with position of asterisk
void passByPtr(int * ptr);

int main(){
    int x = 5;
    printf(&quot;x = %i\n&quot;, x); // 5
    passByVal(x); // prints val = 10

    printf(&quot;x = %i\n&quot;, x); // 5
    passByRef(x); // prints ref = 20

    printf(&quot;x = %i\n&quot;, x); // 20

    // Similar to pass by pointer - also differs from pass by pointer reference
    // this is an integer pointer, xptr, which points to x
    // pointers hold adresses
    int* xptr = &amp;x;
    printf(&quot;x = %i\n&quot;, x); // 20
    // print the derferenced value of xptr, i.e. we don&#39;t want to print the pointer itself, but the
    // value of thing it&#39;s pointing to
    printf(&quot;*xptr = %i\n&quot;, *xptr); // 20

    passByPtr(xptr); // prints *ptr = 30

    printf(&quot;x = %i\n&quot;, x); // 30
    printf(&quot;*xptr = %i\n&quot;, *xptr); // 30

    return 0;
}

// This function passes in a copy of val, so when we modify the value of val in the function body, we can work 
// with the modified version, but later references to val in other functions work with the original.
void passByVal(int val){
    val = 10;
    // %i = val
    printf(&quot;val = %i\n&quot;, val);
}

// This function passes in a reference to &#39;ref&#39; which means that when we set the value of ref to 20 here, later
// code which works with ref now shows it having a value of 20.
void passByRef(int &amp; ref){
    ref = 20;
    printf(&quot;ref = %i\n&quot;, ref);
}

// Very similar to passing by reference but the syntax is a little different.  
void passByPtr(int * ptr){
    // look at the value of ptr
    *ptr = 30;
    printf(&quot;*ptr = %i\n&quot;, *ptr);
}

<div id="what-is-stdsharedptr" class="section level1">
<h1>What is <code>std::sharedptr</code>?</h1>
<p>In the examples above, we discuss raw pointers. They are <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/pointers-cpp?view=msvc-160">discouraged in Modern C++</a> due to the need for manual deletion and memory management. An alternative to raw pointers is <em>smart pointers</em>.</p>
<div id="smart-pointers" class="section level2">
<h2>Smart pointers</h2>
<p>Smart pointers are a modern version of pointers which is a class template and allows memory management to be done via C++ scoping rather than needing to be done manually and without needing to use new or delete keywords.</p>
<p>They can be declared using <code>std::uniqueptr</code>, <code>std::sharedptr</code>, and <code>std::weakptr</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>std::unique_ptr</code> - A unique pointer is a scoped pointer and it destroyed when out of that scope. It cannot be copied. Instantiate via std::make_unique.</p></li>
<li><p><code>std::shared_ptr</code> - Work via counting how many references there are to that pointer. When the reference count reaches 0, the memory is freed. Instantiated via std::make_shared. It can be copied</p></li>
<li><p><code>std::weak_ptr</code> - Doesn’t increase the reference count when you copy a pointer. Good for if you don’t want to take ownership of the entity. It won’t keep it alive.</p></li>

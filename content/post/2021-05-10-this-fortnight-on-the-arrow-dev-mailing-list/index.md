Discussion around integrating OpenTelemetry (a library for distrubuted tracing) into the C++ codebase.  OpenTelemetry allows instrumentation - being able to better make us of telemetry data for diagnosing errors and writing trace information.

## Interval data type
Discussion around a proposal to introduce an interval (i.e. similar to time delta) data type.

## Datafusion process
A previous discussion around incorporating datafusion was restarted, when WM raised the fact that an IP clearance vote may be needed to merge in the codebase, but it was later found to probably not be an issue.

## Registering MIME types
People voted on the proposal to officially register MIME types for Arrow formats - so far every vote has been affirmative.

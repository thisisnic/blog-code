<p>It’s a gorgeous evening in Bath tonight, and my evening has been improved by finding a free table outside at the pub, a large glass of Sauvignon Blanc, and working out how to include a JavaScript confirmation box in Shiny. Here, I’m using Shiny dashboard, although this methodology will work fine with other UI layouts.</p>
<p>In the UI file, near the top of the dashboardBody , call <code>tags$head</code> and <code>tags$script</code> to give the source of the JavaScript file:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tags$head(
  tags$script(src = &#39;custom.js&#39;)
),</code></pre>
<p>Then, in a file named <code>custom.js</code> as above, within the <code>www</code> folder, include the following code. Here, the button which the user clicks on has the inputId set to “submit”.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>$(document).on(&#39;shiny:inputchanged&#39;, function(event) {

  if (event.name === &#39;submit&#39;) {

    var r = confirm(&quot;Are you sure you want to continue?&quot;);
    
    if (r === false) {
      event.preventDefault();
    } 

  }

});</code></pre>

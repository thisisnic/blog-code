      <description>I’ve been meaning to blog for ages, but have been so wrapped up in project things I’ve not found/made the time to do so. Note that around July 2021, Ursa Computing (i.e. where I originally started my apprenticeship) became part of a new company, Voltron Data, but for the sake of simplicity here, I refer to where I work as Voltron Data, even when talking about things that happened prior to July 2021.</description>

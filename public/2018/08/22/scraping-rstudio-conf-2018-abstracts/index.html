<p>RStudio Conference 2019 takes place in January 2019, and this week RStudio put out a <a href="https://blog.rstudio.com/2018/08/20/rstudio-conf-2019-contributed-talks-eposters/">call for contributed talks and e-posters</a>. Though I was eager to browse previous years’ abstracts for inspiration, I couldn’t find them all in one place, and so I decided to use one of my favourite R packages, <code>rvest</code>, to do some web scraping to grab the content.</p>
<p>My main aim was to find all of the abstracts for the contributed talks only from 2018.</p>
<p>As this ended up being an unusually long blog post, here’s a table containing links to the videos and abstract for contributed talks. A detailed walk through of the code used to create it can be found below.</p>
<p>As ever, give me a shout <a href="https://twitter.com/nic_crane">on Twitter</a> if you have any comments or questions!</p>

<p>Here’s a walkthrough of the code, and the full list of abstracts.</p>
<div id="getting-started" class="section level1">
<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>I found last year’s conference schedule [here] (<a href="https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/3105/" class="uri">https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/3105/</a>), which seemed as good a place as any to start. First, I loaded the <code>rvest</code> package and used <code>read_html()</code> (from <code>xml2</code> which is automatically loaded when you load <code>rvest</code>) to pull the html from the page.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(rvest)
my_html &lt;- read_html(&quot;https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/3105/&quot;)
my_html</code></pre>
<pre><code>## {xml_document}
## &lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;
## [1] &lt;head&gt;\n&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;\n&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; cont ...
## [2] &lt;body&gt;\n\n&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;\n.main-container {\n  max-width: 9 ...</code></pre>
<p>The <code>my_html</code> object is an xml document, and to do anything useful with it, I need to work out which components I need. I could do this manually, but it’s much simpler to use <a href="https://selectorgadget.com/">Selector Gadget</a> to help me.</p>
<div id="selector-gadget" class="section level2">
<h2>Selector Gadget</h2>
<p>Selector Gadget is a tool which takes a lot of effort out of webscraping. For an in-depth description, check out <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/vignettes/selectorgadget.html">this rvest vignette</a>. In short, once Selector Gadget is loaded, I click on any unselected components to pick which ones I need (in green), look at what else is highlighted (in yellow) and then click on these to deselect them (now in red) and carry on selecting and/or deselecting components until only the ones I want are in green or yellow.</p>
<p><img src="/images/selector_gadget.png" width="50%" /></p>
<p>Then, I copy the text out of the box, in the case, “.talk-title”. This is the CSS selector needed to grab those components, and I supply this as the <code>css</code> argument to <code>html_nodes()</code>. As I just want the inner text, I pipe the result of this into <code>html_text()</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>talks &lt;- my_html %&gt;%
  html_nodes(&quot;.talk-title&quot;) %&gt;%
  html_text()

head(talks)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;\nTo the Tidyverse and Beyond: Challenges for the Future in Data Science\n\n&quot;
## [2] &quot;\nTo the Tidyverse and Beyond: Challenges for the Future in Data Science\n\n&quot;
## [3] &quot;\nTidy spatial data analysis\n\n&quot;                                            
## [4] &quot;Scaling Shiny apps with async programming&quot;                                   
## [5] &quot;\nRStudio 1.1 new features\n\n&quot;                                              
## [6] &quot;\nThe future of time series and financial analysis in the tidyverse\n\n&quot;</code></pre>
<p>I now repear this process to get the presenter names. Handily, the CSS selector for these is “.presenter”!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>authors &lt;- my_html %&gt;%
  html_nodes(&quot;.presenter&quot;) %&gt;%
  html_text()

head(authors)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Dianne Cook&quot;   &quot;Dianne Cook&quot;   &quot;Edzer Pebesma&quot; &quot;Joe Cheng&quot;    
## [5] &quot;Kevin Ushey&quot;   &quot;Davis Vaughan&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Now I’ve got my talks and authors, I’m next going to combine them in a <code>data_frame</code>. Once this is done, I’m also going to tidy them up by removing all the newline characters (“\n”) from the titles.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)
library(stringr) 
schedule &lt;- data_frame(talks, authors) %&gt;%
  mutate(talks = str_remove_all(talks, &quot;\n&quot;)) %&gt;%
  distinct()

head(schedule)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 x 2

<p>Great! So now what? Well, the point of this analysis is to look at the contributed talks, rather than those from invited speakers or RStudio staff, so in the next part of this post, I’m going to be using lots of <code>dplyr</code> joins to remove these!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="finding-only-contributed-talks" class="section level1">
<h1>Finding Only Contributed Talks</h1>
<p>Let’s start of with identifying talks from invited speakers and RStudio staff.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://blog.rstudio.com/2017/07/12/join-us-at-rstudioconf-2018/">this post on the RStudio blog</a> which lists the invited speakers. I repeat the process from earlier using <code>rvest</code> and <code>xml2</code> functions to scrape the list of invited speakers.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>invited_speakers &lt;- read_html(&quot;https://blog.rstudio.com/2017/07/12/join-us-at-rstudioconf-2018/&quot;) %&gt;%

## 5 Sandra Griffith Invited
## 6 Aaron Horowitz  Invited</code></pre>
<p>Now I need to combine this back with my original table, <code>schedule</code>, so I use <code>left_join()</code> from <code>dplyr</code> to help me.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>author_tbl &lt;- left_join(schedule, invited, by = &quot;authors&quot;) 
head(author_tbl)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 x 3

<p>Something you may have noticed is that we have some duplicated rows in the table, and so I use <code>distinct()</code> to remove these.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>author_tbl &lt;- distinct(author_tbl)
head(author_tbl)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 x 3
##   talks                                                authors      Status

## 6 Developing robust shiny apps with regression testing Winston Cha~ &lt;NA&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Great! Now I’ve remove the duplications, let’s take a look at how many rows have no value in the <code>Status</code> column. I can use <code>sum()</code> and <code>is.na()</code> to do this</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sum(is.na(author_tbl$Status))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 51</code></pre>
<p>I still have 51 rows with no value in the <code>Status</code> column, but I’m only expecting around 20. I need to remove talks from RStudio staff to get to my
contributed talks.</p>
<p>I did the next bit manually, by searching for any of the individuals I hadn’t already heard of. It’s likely that there’s a quicker way to do this, using
the web scraping techniques we’ve already looked at.</p>
<p>In no particular order…</p>

<p>OK, so this is where it gets a little complicated, so please bear with me.</p>
<p>What I need to do next is combine my list of RStudio people with the <code>schedule</code> data_frame. However, I can’t just do a <code>left_join</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>left_join(author_tbl, rstudio, by = &quot;authors&quot;) %&gt;%
  head()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 x 4

<p>Oh no! The left join has created 2 new columns, <code>Status.x</code> and <code>Status.y</code>, representing the value of <code>Status</code> in the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.</p>
<p>This is because all of the RStudio staff already exist in <code>author_tbl</code>, with a <code>Status</code> value of <code>NA</code>.</p>
<p>Sad times! However, a quick trip to Stack Overflow tells me what I need to do:
* Note that more efficient solutions may exist! *</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Extract all of the speakers who are not RStudio staff from <code>author_tbl</code> using <code>anti_join()</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Join my <code>rstudio</code> table with my original <code>schedule</code> table which does not have a <code>Status</code> column, using <code>left_join()</code>. As I removed duplicates after this, I’ll have to do it again, using <code>distinct()</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Combine the outputs from 1 and 2, using <code>bind_rows()</code>. It looks kinda ugly below as I wanted to do it all in a single pipe.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve used <code>tail()</code> to have a peek at the last 6 rows of the data_frame as I expect the rows for all the RStudio staff to be at the bottom of the table.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>author_tbl &lt;- anti_join(author_tbl, rstudio, by = &quot;authors&quot;) %&gt;%
  bind_rows(
    left_join(rstudio, schedule, by = &quot;authors&quot;) %&gt;%

<p>Hooray!</p>
<p>I skim through the data and realise I probably need to add a <code>Status</code> value for the keynote speakers. JJ Allaire has already been included in <code>RStudio</code>, so it’s just Dianne Cook that I need to add. I use the same technique as before:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>keynotes &lt;- data_frame(authors = &quot;Dianne Cook&quot;,
                       Status = &quot;keynote&quot;)

author_tbl &lt;- anti_join(author_tbl, keynotes, by = &quot;authors&quot;) %&gt;%
  bind_rows(
    inner_join(keynotes, schedule, by = &quot;authors&quot;) %&gt;%
      distinct()
  )</code></pre>
<p>I have a quick look over the data, and remove the discussions and closing remarks from the data using <code>filter()</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>author_tbl &lt;- author_tbl %&gt;%
filter(!talks %in% c(&quot;R in industry discussion&quot;, &quot;Tidyverse discussion&quot;, &quot;Closing remarks&quot;) )</code></pre>
<p>Finally, I <code>filter()</code> again to only show the rows for which the <code>Status</code> column contains an <code>NA</code>, and drop the now-redundant <code>Status</code> column.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>contributed_talks &lt;- filter(author_tbl, is.na(Status)) %&gt;%
  select(-Status)

<p>I’m now left with around 20 talks, which is the number I expected. Hooray!</p>
<p>The final step is to get hold of the abstracts.</p>
</div>
<div id="getting-the-urls-of-the-abstracts" class="section level1">
<h1>Getting the URLs of the Abstracts</h1>
<p>The only place I could find the abstracts for the talks was on the individual videos, so there’s a final bit of webscraping to do.</p>
<p>Like before, I used <code>read_html()</code> to pull the entire page, and then <code>html_nodes()</code> and <code>html_text()</code> to pull out the text.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>video_links &lt;- read_html(&quot;https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/rstudioconf-2018-talks/&quot;)

<p>I also need the links to the pages where the talks are. To pull these out, instead of <code>html_text()</code>, I used <code>html_attr()</code> which extracts everything with a specified attribute, in this case, “href” for the link locations.</p>

<p>Great! Now I’m ready to combine my titles, links, and names. If we look at the first few elements of <code>names</code>, <code>titles</code> and <code>links</code>, we can see that there is an erroneous extra value in <code>titles</code> and <code>links</code> but not <code>names</code> - I must have accidentally picked this up with my selectors from earlier.</p>

<h1>Scraping the Abstracts</h1>
<p>In order to scrape the abstracts from the table of talks and URLs, I need to:</p>

<li>Use the relevant selector to pull out just the abstract text nodes</li>
<li>Use <code>html_text()</code> to pull just the text out of each node.</li>

the components I want:</p>

## [1] &quot;The Imagine Boston 2030 plan was released in July 2017 as the City of Boston’s first long-term plan in 50 years. After hearing from more than 15,000 residents, five major goals were outlined in the plan – (1) encourage affordability, reduce displacement, and improve quality of life, (2) increase access to opportunity, (3) drive inclusive economic growth, (4) promote a healthy environment and prepare for climate change, and (5) invest in open space, arts &amp; culture, transportation, and infrastructure – each of which are tracked through a series of different metrics. Using R-Shiny, we developed a public-facing dashboard (https://analytics.boston.gov/app/imagine-boston) that interactively displays data associated with each of the goals and metrics allowing users to quickly gain an understanding of how close we are to achieving the goals laid out in the plan. By publicly displaying the data, the dashboard helps the City keep itself accountable and empowers the public to make sure we’re actively working towards creating the Boston they want to see.&quot;
## [2] &quot;The code behind the dashboard has gone through a series of revisions and in the process has gone from being a few large files to modularized and reusable. In addition to showcasing the dashboard, this talk will tell the story of why the dashboard was built using R-Shiny and how we took our code from something that “just works” to developing reusable components that are being implemented in other dashboards the City is creating.&quot;

## [1] &quot;How can we effectively but gently launch new students into the world of data science? In this talk, I will discuss the ways that Albert Y. Kim and I have gone about approaching this by creating an open source, fully reproducible textbook using the bookdown package at ModernDive.com. The textbook uses the paradigm of books as versions instead of editions featuring an introductory “getting started” chapter with links to many videos and interactive content available on DataCamp.com to support new R users. I’ll also discuss how we used #chalktalk (instead of slides) to slow down our instruction to help beginners grasp tidyverse and coding concepts. I will take a glimpse into the new infer package for statistical inference, which performs statistical inference using an expressive syntax that follows tidy design principles. Lastly, I’ll demonstrate vignettes and R Markdown reports that our students created to further support the emerging tidyverse community ecosystem and I’ll provide future goals for our ModernDive.com project.&quot;

## [1] &quot;Sports Betting markets are one of the purest prediction markets that exist and are yet vastly misunderstood by the public. Unlike most others markets, such as finance, sports can be measured in the physical world and thus a vast array of statistical data exists. Since the late 90s, Pinnacle has been one of the largest sportsbooks in the world and also one of the only sportsbooks who will take wagers from professional bettors (who we expect to lose to). At Pinnacle our focus is on modeling, automation, data science and R is a central piece of our business. We are constantly trying to innovate and make the best use out of our large volumes of data.&quot;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
## [2] &quot;In the last few years, we have undertaken the monumental task of training our 400+ employee workforce to better understand data and how to use data to drive all business decisions, whether it be prediction markets, customer service, marketing, payment solutions, etc. Many of these employees previously had no background in Data Science or had ever written a line of code. On this journey, We have recorded data on where students commonly fail or get frustrated and tried to weigh that with the skills we know are needed to solve real business problems. We have since come up with a well-defined set of curriculum using pieces from Data Camp, along with the custom curriculum. With this has come a focus on tidyverse, specifically mastering dplyr, and cutting out some of the core materials, such as working with matrices. Along the way, we have learned many lessons and have many success stories to share, such as former secretaries or customer service reps being retrained and promoted Data Scientists, who now work every day on using our data to make smarter business decisions. We would like to tell our story so that the community can learn from our mistakes and successes.&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This takes a while as there are a lof of asbtracts to pull, but once it’s done, it’s looking good. This object is a list, each element containing a character vector of length 1 or more for each abstract. I want to make sure they’re all only 1 item long, so use <code>vapply()</code> to <code>paste()</code> the contents of each abstract into a single character object.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>abstracts &lt;- vapply(abstracts, function(abstract){
  paste(abstract, collapse = &quot;  &quot;)
}, character(1))</code></pre>
<p>Finally, I append the abstracts column onto my <code>talks_and_urls</code> table. I’ve not displayed it here, as the result is huge on the page.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>talks_and_urls$abstracts = abstracts</code></pre>
<p>So here we have it, the full list of abstracts. I’m not 100% sure it’s accurate, as
<a href="https://blog.rstudio.com/2017/11/06/rstudio-conf-2018-program/">this post</a> on the RStudio blog suggests different numbers of people for each status. My best guess is that couple of people I have down as delivering “contributed” talks were actually invited speakers who were invited after the publication of this blog post.</p>

It's a gorgeous evening in Bath tonight, and my evening has been improved by finding a free table outside at the pub, a large glass of Sauvignon Blanc, and working out how to include a JavaScript confirmation box in Shiny.  Here, I'm using Shiny dashboard, although this methodology will work fine with other UI layouts.

In the UI file, near the top of the dashboardBody , call `tags$head` and `tags$script` to give the source of the JavaScript file:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
tags$head(
  tags$script(src = 'custom.js')
),
```


Then, in a file named `custom.js` as above, within the `www` folder, include the following code.  Here, the button which the user clicks on has the inputId set to "submit".

```{R, eval = FALSE}
$(document).on('shiny:inputchanged', function(event) {

  if (event.name === 'submit') {

    var r = confirm("Are you sure you want to continue?");
    
    if (r === false) {
      event.preventDefault();
    } 

  }

});

```

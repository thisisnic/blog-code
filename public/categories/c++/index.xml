      <description>I’m approaching learning C++ by taking both a top-down and bottom-up approach, looking at tutorials and learning the basics whilst also working with existing C++ code in the Arrow codebase.
I wanted to take a snippet of code from something that I’ve been working on an enhance my understanding of it. I posted this on Slack, and my colleagues were generous with their time and knowledge, helping me check my understanding, which I’m now going to outline below.</description>

      <description>  When people use the phrase “modern C++”, they’re usually referring to C++ 11 onwards.
Libraries The main libraries in C++ are:
The C++ standard library Standard Template Library (contains things like algorithms, iterators, etc) Boost (some really great stuff in here; some of it is moving into the standard library) QT framework (for cross-platform UI) Intel libraries (lots of others!)   </description>

      <description>SEXP is short for S Expression. It is the C struct used to represent every type of object in R. C functions that talk to R must used the SEXP type for both inputs and outputs.</description>

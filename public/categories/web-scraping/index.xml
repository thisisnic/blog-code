      <description>RStudio Conference 2019 takes place in January 2019, and this week RStudio put out a call for contributed talks and e-posters. Though I was eager to browse previous years’ abstracts for inspiration, I couldn’t find them all in one place, and so I decided to use one of my favourite R packages, rvest, to do some web scraping to grab the content.
My main aim was to find all of the abstracts for the contributed talks only from 2018.</description>

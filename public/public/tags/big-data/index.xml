      <description>When I started my career in data science, I was in the common position of having familiarity with technologies like R, Python, and SQL, but much less with big data technologies. I remember feeling intimidated by big data; there were lots of different technologies named after animals or making some sort of pun I wasnâ€™t clued up enough to understand.
Flash forward 18 months and with experience, some parts of the big data landscape felt a bit more familiar.</description>
